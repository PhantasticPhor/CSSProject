                    My name is Marc Frances and I am a 3rd year GIMM student. I was born and raised in Las Vegas Nevada and
                    no I
                    don't live in any of the hotels. For as long as I can remember I've loved PC games. I remember trying so
                    desperatly to launch games on my familys old computer just so I could enjoy Half-Life. The PC ran at 2
                    seconds per frame and it was the greatest slideshow of my life. This simple interest stemmed out into
                    many
                    different areas such as computer hardware. This led to a big youtube rabbit hole and it eventually
                    helped me
                    get into PC building. I've helped friends and I've built for myself. In GIMM, from what I experienced so
                    far, I would say that VR development is my favorite part. Making a VR game was probably one of the most
                    self
                    fulfilling things I have ever done. It's enough to make me not feel useless.

                I am a Junior at Boise State University and a third year GIMM student in the college of innovation and design.
        I have always wanted to learn more about computers and how they worked. I was always curious of how computers
        were
        able to communicate between each other and allow us to communicate as well. That curiosity drove me to study
        more
        about computers and how they worked. This led me to an interest in using code to design art, and or build games.
        This was taught by our teachers as a great tool for learning new information. But it didn't just teach us how to
        view
        learning and seeing it in a new perspective, but it also taught us how to fail. What I mean is that, GIMM brings
        a lot
        of challenges your way. They understand the real world and how us learning will translate to jobs after college,
        so
        they teach you to try anything and everything. And if you fail, learn from your mistake and try again with the
        knowledge
        you have learned. And in the real world, life is going to give you challenges and problems that seem impossible.
        But
        by not giving up and pushing through all the challenges, you will surprise yourself with what you can
        accomplish.

                My name is Jason Tipp. I am a 2nd year GIMM student. I was born in Chicago then moved to Kirkland
    Washington when I was 3. Some of my favorite activities are skiing and playing tennis.
    Both of which I also started at the age of 3. I love the outdoors, but I have a huge passion for video games! I
    think this love started when I got lego star wars for the game cube. Then getting Lego Starwars the Complete Saga
    changed my world!
    I remember my friends and I would come over to my house and just play it for hours and hours. I would later get more
    and more invested into video games. I would watch people play these games on YouTube. I really enjoy it and got a
    lot of laughes out of them!
    I ended up getting most of these games that people would play just because I got so much enjoyment watching them.
    This is what got me into Halo Minecraft and Call of Duty.
